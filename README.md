   SORA_API_KEY=your-sora-api-key
   ```

4. (Optional) Add extra features with `AZURE_TTS`:

   - `AZURE_TTS` is a JSON object containing the subscription key and endpoint for the Azure Text-to-Speech service:

     ```
     AZURE_TTS={"subscriptionKey":"your subscription key","endpoint":"your endpoint"}
     ```
   
   - `API_DALLE_URL` and `API_DALLE_KEY` for DALL-E API service:
   - `GPT_IMAGE_1_API_URL` and `GPT_IMAGE_1_API_KEY` for GPT-Image-1 API service:
   
     ```
     API_DALLE_URL=yourdalleapiurl
     API_DALLE_KEY=yourdalleapikey
     ```

   - **Sora Video Generation Configuration**: To enable advanced video generation features, add your Sora API credentials:

     ```
     SORA_API_URL=https://yourserver.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/sora/video/generations/jobs?api-version=2025-02-15-preview
     SORA_API_KEY=your-sora-api-key
     ```

     **Important Notes for Sora Setup**:
     - Ensure your Azure OpenAI deployment includes Sora model access
     - The Sora API uses the latest preview API version (2025-02-15-preview)
     - Video generation requires significant processing time - jobs are handled asynchronously     

5. Continue with Azure AD Configuration. Add the following keys to your `.env` file for authentication. You will need to set up scopes, which are permissions granted to your application to access certain resources on behalf of the user.

   ```
   CLOUD_INSTANCE=https://login.microsoftonline.com/
   TENANT_ID=your-azure-tenant-id
   CLIENT_ID=your-azure-client-id
   CLIENT_SECRET=your-azure-client-secret
   REDIRECT_URI=your-azure-redirect-uri
   POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI=your-azure-post-logout-redirect-uri
   SCOPES=your-app-api-scope
   GRAPH_API_ENDPOINT=https://graph.microsoft.com/ # The graph API endpoint string should end with a trailing slash
   EXPRESS_SESSION_SECRET=Enter_the_Express_Session_Secret_Here
   ```

   To set up `SCOPES`:

   - Login to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
   - Navigate to `Azure Active Directory` > `App registrations` and select your application.
   - In the `Expose an API` section, click on `Add a scope`. Here you will define the permissions your application requires.
   - Follow the instructions in the portal to add the scopes you need. For example, for accessing the Microsoft Graph API, you might add a scope like `user.read`.
   - Once your scopes are created, note down the full URI of the scope, it will look something like `api://<your-application-client-id>/access_as_user` for a custom API or `https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read` for a Microsoft service like Graph API.
   - In your `.env` file, set the `SCOPES` variable to these values. If specifying multiple scopes, separate them by spaces.

   **Important**: Ensure the `SCOPES` format aligns with what your application's functionalities require. For backend access, it would typically be `api://<Application (client) ID>/<scope-name>`. For Microsoft Graph, it can be a URL like `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default` or specific permissions like `https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read`.
  
   **Note**: The exact `scope` string is critical for the correct operation of OAuth and OpenID Connect flows. Misconfiguration can result in authorization errors.

6. Replace the following placeholders in the `utils/authConfig.js` file:

```
const cloudInstance = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/";
const tenantId = "a5fb26eb-4aac-4ae5-b7d2-****";
const scopes = "api://812a857f-f189-4aeb-b086-*****/user_impersonation";
const clientId = "812a857f-f189-4aeb-b086-";
const redirectUri = "https://chat.aiassist007.com/";
```
with your Azure AD configuration.

Why am I not putting this in the `.env` file? Because I encountered some issues with the `authConfig.js` file when I placed the values in the `.env` file. I also need to insert the values in GitHub actions for my CI/CD pipeline. It does not work well with the CI pipeline; sometimes it works, and other times it does not (It will be replaced with MISSING_ENV_VARIABLES). If you have any suggestions to fix this issue, please let me know. Thank you!

7. Install the necessary packages:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

8. Start the server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

9. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to enjoy the chatGPT for your own!

## 🎬 Using Sora Video Generation

Once you have configured the Sora API credentials, you can start generating videos:

### Accessing Sora Features:
1. **Via Chat Interface**: Look for the video generation option in the chat interface
2. **Sora Studio**: Access dedicated video generation tools through the Sora Studio interface
3. **Direct Integration**: Use Sora capabilities directly within conversation flows

### Video Generation Process:
1. **Enter Description**: Provide a detailed text description of your desired video
2. **Set Parameters**: Configure video settings (duration, aspect ratio, quality level)
3. **Submit Request**: Start the video generation job
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track generation status with real-time updates
5. **Download Result**: Access your completed video once generation finishes

### Best Practices for Sora Prompts:
- **Be Descriptive**: Include detailed visual descriptions, camera movements, and scene elements
- **Specify Style**: Mention artistic style, lighting, mood, and atmosphere
- **Include Motion**: Describe desired movements, transitions, and dynamic elements
- **Set Context**: Provide scene setting, time of day, environment details

### Example Sora Prompts:
```
"A serene mountain lake at sunrise with gentle ripples on the water surface, golden light reflecting off the peaks, and a small wooden boat slowly drifting across the frame"

"A bustling cyberpunk city street at night with neon signs, flying cars, and rain creating colorful reflections on wet pavement, cinematic wide shot"

"Close-up of a blooming flower in a garden, time-lapse style, with morning dew drops and soft natural lighting, macro photography aesthetic"
```

### Generated Video Management:
- Videos are automatically saved to the `public/generated-videos/` directory
- Each video includes metadata and generation parameters
- Download videos directly through the web interface
- Organize videos by project or theme using the built-in management system

## 📊 Profile Migration to Azure Table Storage（For user from older version)

This project now supports storing AI profiles in Azure Table Storage instead of JSON files. To migrate your existing profiles, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Make sure your Azure Storage Connection String is correctly set in the `.env` file:
  ```
  AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=your-azure-storage-connection-string
  ```

### Migration Options

#### Option 1: Use the Migration Script

For migrating a specific user's profile:

```bash
# Migrate a specific user's profile
node scripts/runMigration.js yourusername@example.com
```

#### Option 2: Migrate All Profiles

If you want to migrate all user profiles:

```bash
# Migrate all user profiles from .data directory
node scripts/migrateProfilesToAzure.js --all
```

#### Option 3: Programmatic Migration

You can also trigger the migration programmatically:

```javascript
const { initProfileMigration } = require('./services/profileMigrationInit');

// Migrate a specific user's profile
await initProfileMigration('yourusername@example.com');
```

### Table Structure

The AI profiles are stored in Azure Table Storage with the following structure:

- **Table name**: `AIProfiles`
- **Partition key**: Username (email)
- **Row key**: Profile name
- **Properties**:
  - `profileData`: Complete profile JSON (stringified)
  - `sortedIndex`: Profile's sort order (extracted for easier filtering)
  - `description`: Profile description (extracted for easier filtering)
  - `timestamp`: Last update time

### Verification

After migration, you can verify the data has been correctly migrated by:
- Checking the Azure Storage Explorer for the `AIProfiles` table
- Logging in to the application and confirming all your profiles are available

Now you're all set to explore and develop your chatbot application using JavaScript and the Azure OpenAI API. Happy coding! 🎉
